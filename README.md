Cora is a terminal tool for Arch-based distros that replaces complex pacman commands with simple human-readable ones. Instead of `sudo pacman -S pkg` you just type `cora install pkg`. Includes package management, mirror updates, system maintenance and more — built to make the terminal accessible for Linux beginners.
